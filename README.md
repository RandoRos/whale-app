# WhaleApp

This is a basic UI app for interracting with [whale-api](https://github.com/RandoRos/whale-api) backend server.
It shows list of supported tokens and allows to open each individual details.

Implementation wise it is using `React + Vite Typescript` with `React-Query` and `React-Router`. For styling `TailwindCSS` and testing is done using `Vitest` and `React-Testing-Libary`

This App if very bearbones and does not have lot of functionality, as it was not required.
